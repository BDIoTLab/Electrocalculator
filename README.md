# Electrocalculator
Project description:
    This simple calculator takes a variety of inputs depending on the option chosen by the user, and these are used to compute
    the Electric field (or Capacitance even, for one particular option) magnitude for a chosen Symmetrical shape.
    The user is prompted for the different values when required, and several tests ensure that invalid input is dealt with accurately
    so that the user has another chance to give a value.

Motivation:
Essentially, my aim was to create something which would use what I had learnt over the past academic year at UBC.
Using the knowledge from one of my first year Physics courses (PHYS-158), and several pages online (for reference), I made the Electrocalculator to shorten the computation time of Electromagnetism problems which would have taken someone a few minutes (~5 mins) to do by hand, on their own.

Program details:
Written in Java, the electricFields class is the main driver, whereas the other 3 classes deal with the shapes which bear their name.
